<!-- title: What is AVO -->

# TL:DR

<p>Basically, AVO is writing CSS selectors like this:</p>



```css
[data-bg-color="red"] {
  color: red;
}
```

Where `data-bg-color` is a data attribute.

<Help>
  <p>
    Data attributes basically are special attributes that do not have a specific
    role to play in terms of HTML markup functionality. Their sole purpose is to
    provide the developer/designer a way to lean on in case they want to craft
    custom tailored functionality or experiences using the information on them.
